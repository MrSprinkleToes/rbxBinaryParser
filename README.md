# Building

Contributions to this project are welcome!

To build this project, you need to install webpack.
This can be done by running `npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli`. (make sure you have npm installed!)

With webpack installed, open the project directory and run:

```
npm run build --target=[server,client]
```

Setting the target to server will build for nodejs, while client will build for the browser.
