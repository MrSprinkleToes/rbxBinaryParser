# Building

Contributions to this project are welcome!

To build this project, you need to install webpack.
This can be done by running `npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli`. (make sure you have npm installed!)

With webpack installed, open the project directory and run:

| Command | Function |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `npm run build --target=[server,client]` | Builds for the specified target. If you are building on Windows, use `build:win`. |
| `npm run buildAll` | Builds for both targets. |
